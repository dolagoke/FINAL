            <h2>The Plot</h2>
            <p>
                The plot begins in a world where humans live within vast walled cities to protect themselves from Titans, giant humanoid beasts that consume humans seemingly without reason. The story follows Eren Yeager, a young kid whose life is permanently changed when the Colossal Titan attacks his community, causing a disastrous breach of the walls. Driven by loss and hatred, Eren joins the military with his childhood pals Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert.

                As the story unfolds, it dives into the mysteries surrounding the Titans, the origins of humanity's imprisonment, and the secrets hidden within the walls themselves. The novel progresses from a simple survival story to a complicated tale of moral quandaries, political machinations, and the aftermath of war.
